            My name is Radwa Aboudina. I am a current student in the MIT Full stack web development program. I have a
            BSc and an MSc degrees in computer engineering. I've worked in image processing, parallel processing, and
            did some research in NLP. I've always worked with object oriented programming languages like C++ and some
            scientific programming platforms like MATLAB.
            I am a mother of two beautiful children. I've had a long gap from my career to take care of my kids. Now
            that they are older, I decided to get back to work with a focus on web development. I joined the MIT program
            to gain the required knowledge and experience needed to get started as a web developer. <br><br>
